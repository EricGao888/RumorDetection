Pytorch version attention 

data process: under /dataset
twitter15_new and twitter16_new has the data  which is same for Tree Structure
process.py load the data from the twitter15_new and twitter16_new to pickle file which is used in run.py

python run.py => this is only attention version.  The main file
python run_cnn.py => this is the attention version with CNN of user profile. The result is bad, just for reference
